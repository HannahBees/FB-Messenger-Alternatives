# FB-Messenger-Alternatives
Alternatives to FB Messenger and WhatsApp, and why you should totally use them.

Problems with FB Messenger
	- Privacy policy: What they are allowed to do with the information you provide them
		+ FB is allowed to collect anything you create, share, message or communicate. This includes things such as the location a photo was taken.
		+ They use this information to personalise your FB and the FBs of people you know.
		+ They sell information based on this to advertisers.
		+ They use this information to detect if you are using a "fake" name, and generally prevent anonymity.

	- Provides no information as to whether your information is encrypted.

	- FB Messenger gathers information about people you text/call, and uses this to:
		+ Suggest friends for you.
		+ Suggest you as a friend for other people.
		+ This could be particularly risky for sex workers, and other people with occupations where privacy and anonymity are essential for safety.

	- Permissions given to the mobile app:
		+ Far beyond the scope of what the app actually does.
		+ Can be used to read other information on the phone.
		+ Could be used to do thin gs that cost you money, like send texts or make calls.

Problems with WhatsApp
	- Free for a year, then costs money.

	- Terms of Service
		+ Stores information that allows it to be turned over to somebody accusing you of copyright infringment.

	- Information stored is NOT encrypted on the server. It is only encrypted going between your phone and the server.

	- Permissions given to mobile app: See FB
		+ While the Terms of Service do not give WhatsApp the legal right to harvest information from your phone, the app would still allow them to do so. Also, anybody who hacked their servers could be able to access informtion on your phone.
