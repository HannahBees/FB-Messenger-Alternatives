# FB-Messenger-Alternatives
Alternatives to FB Messenger and WhatsApp, and why you should totally use them.

Problems with FB Messenger
	- Privacy policy: What they are allowed to do with the information you provide them
		+ FB is allowed to collect anything you create, share, message or communicate. This includes things such as the location a photo was taken.
		+ They use this information to personalise your FB and the FBs of people you know.
		+ They sell information based on this to advertisers.
		+ They use this information to detect if you are using a "fake" name, and generally prevent anonymity.

	- FB Messenger gathers information about people you text/call, and uses this to:
		+ Suggest friends for you.
		+ Suggest you as a friend for other people.
		+ This could be particularly risky for sex workers, and other people with occupations where privacy and anonymity are essential for safety.

	- Permissions given to the mobile app:
		+ Far beyond the scope of what the app actually does.
		+ Can be used to read other information on the phone.
		+ Could be used to do thin gs that cost you money, like send texts or make calls.
